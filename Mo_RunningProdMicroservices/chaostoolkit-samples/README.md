# Welcome to the Chaos Toolkit Samples

Within this project there are a number of samples that aim to demonstrate how Chaos Engineering experiments can be constructed and executed to build confidence that weaknesses are not present in a microservice-based system.

The full catalogue of samples include:
* [Service Down Not Visible To Users][service-down] - Where an experiment is executes that highlights a weakness and this is then learned from and a circuit breaker is applied to overcome this discovered weakness.
